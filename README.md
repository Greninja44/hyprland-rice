# MY ARCH HYPRLAND SETUP

This repository contains my personal Hyprland rice, including my Hyde project setups and custom configurations. The goal of this rice is to provide a complete desktop environment setup for Arch Linux users using Hyprland as the window manager.

The repository includes configurations for Hyprland, Waybar, Rofi, Kitty terminal, Starship prompt, Dunst notifications, and other utilities. All the configurations are tailored for a clean and productive workflow while maintaining an aesthetic look.

To use this rice, clone the repository to your home directory and copy the configuration files into your `.config` folder. Additionally, copy the shell configuration files such as `.zshrc` to your home directory. After copying, you may need to install the necessary dependencies such as Waybar, Rofi, Kitty, and Starship to ensure everything works as expected.

The Hyde project rice contains my personal tweaks, themes, and scripts that are integrated into this rice. These custom setups enhance usability and provide a consistent workflow across the desktop environment. Screenshots, wallpapers, and additional customization files are included to replicate my setup more accurately.

This rice is intended for learning and inspiration. Feel free to adapt the configurations to your own workflow. Keep in mind that some paths or themes may require modification depending on your system and installed applications.
